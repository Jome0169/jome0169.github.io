You mentioned changing the 'tufte-css' header to be your resume. I see that your resume file is `MendietaResume_2026.pdf` located in the `resume/` directory.

Currently, the `header` option is set to `false` in your `_config.yml`, which means the subtitle 'A Jekyll theme based on tufte-css' is not displayed.

Could you please clarify what you mean by 'header'?
1.  Do you want to add a link to your resume in the main navigation bar?
2.  Do you want to enable the main header and replace the subtitle with a link to your resume?
3.  Do you want to change the site description in `_config.yml`?

Once I understand your intent, I can proceed with the changes.
