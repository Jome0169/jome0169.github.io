I've been spending alot of time using snakemake recently, and I absoutly love
it. It makes processing a ton of files relativly easy, and does a ton of the
self documenting itself. Paired with this is that it's far more pliable than a
bash script.

That being said, I feel like I revisit the same 20 stack overflow examples. So,
here's an ever updating list of examples I find useful

1. How to mix Globbing and Wilcards

2. How to use a nested YAML file
