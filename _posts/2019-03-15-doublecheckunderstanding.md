Honestly, you probably know less than you think you do. I can't
tell you how often I have been bitten in the ass by making an assumption about
something I THOUGHT I understood, when in actuallity I was totally missing the
point. So, here's a list a few things you should activly question about.

### Do you actually understand strand aware sequencing? Can you draw it out?
#### Are you sure?

If not, this is quick, and totally worth your time.
