### About Me

I'm Pablo Mendieta, a computational biologist with 10+ yeas of experience in genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics technologies and algorithsm. I received my PhD from the University of Georgia in the Lab of Dr. Robert Schmitz {% sidenote 'origin ' "Or "Bob" as everyone in the academic world knows him by. I've talked to a number of people who didn't know who Robert was but instantly knew about bob." %} where I focused on functional genomics, gene regulation, and cis regulation and evolution in plant genomes. All as a way to fuel the next generation of agriculture to combat climate change. For a detailed list of my work feel free to check out my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=KbCxlTIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). If you're interested in more of my experiences check out my resume over in (/page/resume).

Post graduate school I'm working as a computational biologist at Inari Agriculture where I'm applying these same techniques and my knowledge bases to making seed products.

This website is a series of my writings about different parts of the genetics/genomics field as well as a reference database. Additionally this year (2026) I'll be embarking on a series of personal experiments where I will test the ability of LLMs to do science in somewhat basic and controlled settings. Starting from simple genome annotation and alignemnt to complex - comparative genomics of plants? All opinions expressed on this blog are my own.
